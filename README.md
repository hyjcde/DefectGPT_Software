## üìã Abstract

Building asset management is hindered by data heterogeneity and semantic gaps, yielding data-rich yet insight-poor operations. This dissertation presents **DefectGPT**, instantiated as an interactive platform that transforms static, multimodal building data into a dynamic, verifiable knowledge system.

The framework contributes:
1. **Integrated Defect Profile (IDP)**: A lightweight, domain-specific semantic model that consolidates heterogeneous defect evidence into provenance-aware, LLM-consumable units, resolving knowledge fragmentation
2. **Tool-augmented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent**: Autonomously orchestrates domain procedures to perform complex spatio-semantic reasoning with strong faithfulness and interpretability

The platform is validated via a deep case study on a large warehouse, comparative benchmarking against state-of-the-art knowledge-graph pipelines and human experts, and ablation analyses isolating the value of IDP and tool orchestration. Results indicate expert-level diagnostic accuracy and faithfulness, significantly outperforming established baselines.

Crucially, the platform enables a paradigm shift from passive data querying to interactive trustworthy knowledge discourse, underpinned by a rigorous evidence-provenance mechanism that makes every conclusion verifiable and explainable. A portfolio-scale study across ten buildings further demonstrates operational scalability, charting a practical path beyond static digital twins toward truly interactive and trustworthy human-AI knowledge systems.

## üìñ Research Context

In the contemporary process of urbanization, buildings serve as the core carriers of human activities, representing significant investments in infrastructure and resources. However, traditional building asset management faces critical challenges:

- **Data Heterogeneity**: Fragmented data sources (BIM, GIS, sensors, maintenance logs)
- **Semantic Gaps**: Lack of unified understanding across different data modalities
- **Limited Interactivity**: Static data querying without dynamic reasoning
- **Trust Issues**: Lack of explainability and verifiability in AI-driven insights

DefectGPT addresses these challenges by creating an interactive, trustworthy knowledge system that transforms static building data into dynamic, actionable intelligence.
